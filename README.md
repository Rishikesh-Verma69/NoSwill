The app facilitates the redistribution of leftover food to those in need, ensuring that consumable food reaches those who can benefit from it. Additionally, NoSwill offers a solution for food no longer suitable for consumption by enabling restaurants to sell these waste materials to fertilizer manufacturers. This dual-purpose approach not only reduces food waste but also promotes sustainable practices by converting inedible food into valuable agricultural products.
